3 processes:
 - Image -> Text (OCR?)
 - Text -> Document Formatting
 - Document -> Portable Printer (A seperate program?)

 First thing:  - Image -> Text (OCR?)
  - takes the photo from the Input folder then converts it to text 

  I read through the documentations and essentially what I have to do is:
    OpenCV:
        take in the image, 
        filters and process the image,

    Pytessseract (the wrapper) with Tesseract OCR (exe)
        then extract the handwriting from the image

  OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library
    (usually in C++) -> currently using python as a wrapper
    - can be utilized for face detection, OCR preprocessing etc

    created virtual environment to not polute the global environment

    I want to first make an MVP starting with jpg file to test it, knowing I can easily convert the files to jpg or implement further adaptation later.  then I will denoise it then process it however let me focus on getting the jpg file from disc first.

    the image extracted is giveen in np.ndarray format:
        NumPy N-Dimensional Array
        Grayscale	(height, width)	2D array, 1 value per pixel
        Color (BGR)	(height, width, 3)	3D array, 3 values/pixel
        for storing image values
        like storing an image based on its positions and color values of each pixels


      To find the texts, I would need to figure out how to seperate the lines.
